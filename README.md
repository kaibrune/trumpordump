# Trump or Dump?
Politics via Twitter? Trump makes it possible. But what exactly is he tweeting all day? In TrumpOrDump, you decide which tweet is genuine and which is not. You think that's easy? Well, then look at what dump the jerk posts.

### 🔍 How does it work?
Basically, the game is as easy as the politics of Trump himself. Randomly selected tweets are displayed and you have to decide if they are real or fake. Your answer is supported with a personal audio comment of the president himself. This can be deactivated in the settings panel located behind the small ℹ︎ on the right hand side. 

### 📋 Features 

- Test your twitter knowledge
- Listen to Trumps voice all day
- Try to get not upset about the bullshit he posts

### 🔥 Demo

Give it a try at [TrumpOrDump.de](https://trumpordump.de).

**ProTip:** The game is also great as a **drinking game**. Have a go, at every wrong answer.
